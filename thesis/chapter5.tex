\chapter{Evaluation}



  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Named Entities
    \begin{itemize}
    \item AQL contains more named entities than the other query logs. (Due to the overall bigger size?)
    \item Zipf's law is followed pretty well by all query logs.
    \item AQL shows a small deviation from Zipf's law at the most frequent entities (What is the reason? Entities of a specific domain?).
    \end{itemize}
    \item words
    \begin{itemize}
        \item AQL contains more words than the other query logs. (Due to the overall bigger size?)
        \item Zipf's law is followed reasonably well by the query logs.
        \item Again, we observe small deviations from Zipf's law by the AQL log's graph.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
    \item Queries
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Zipf's law is followed well by the query logs.
        \item AQL contains more queries than the other query logs. (Due to the overall bigger size?)
        \item AQL shows a small deviation from Zipf's law at the most frequent queries (What is the reason?).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Characters
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Zipf's law is not followed by any of the query logs.
        \item The most frequent characters are significantly more frequent than the other characters.
        \item AQL and MS-MARCO contain more characters than AOL and ORCAS. (Due to more involved languages?)
        \item Some sudden drops in frequency are striking in the AQL log's and the MS-MARCO log's graph. (What is the reason? -> Maybe the general frequency of languages and therefore the frequency of characters belonging to that language?)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
