%%% Recommended source for BibTeX entries: https://dblp.org/
%%% Still, you might want to post-process some of the DBLP BibTeX entries ...

%%% ... like changing to titlecase in the title and series fields below and probably removing the DBLP-specific fields timestamp, biburl, and bibsource

}

%%% Recommended bibkeys: <last name first author>:<year> 
%%% (in case of a key collision add a, b, c, ... at the end)

%%% When some BibTeX entry is not available at DBLP, try to mimick DBLP's "look and feel" like below

  year      = {1958}
}

%%% Finally, you will probably most often cite some conference papers; make sure to rather not fetch the cross-referenced BibTex entries from DBLP
%%% Suggested change to the standard BibTeX entry: endash (--) for the date range of a conference (like in the pages field)
