\chapter{Introduction}

Search engine query logs are an important resource to promote research in information retrieval~\citep{agosti:2012}. They enable analyzing user behavior and user experience, improving query suggestions and query reformulations or provide data to train retrieval models for re-ranking~\citep{reimer:2023}. Consequently, a vast access to search engine query logs would be highly beneficial for the research community. Additionally, public access to search engine query logs is valuable to create transparency and facilitate investigations on the fairness of major search engine's ranking algorithms~\citep{reimer:2023}. However, despite the high value of query logs, they remain publicly unavailable for the most part. This is due to multiple reasons. On the one hand, the publication of query logs brings up privacy concerns, as they contain sensitive information about the users~\citep{reimer:2023}. On the other hand, search engine operators' interests may not align with the previous mentioned motivations to publish query logs, as higher competition in the search engine market may arise or a comprehensive transparency of the search engines' behavior may simply not be desired in the first place by the operators~\citep{reimer:2023}. Nonetheless, a few public query logs exist, among which the AOL query log~\citep{pass:06} is the most prominent and comprehensive one~\citep{reimer:2023}. However, publicly available query logs are not on par with private query logs collected by major search engine operators. This applies for the mere size of the log, specifically the number of queries, but also for the temporal span the queries were collected in. Furthermore, public available query logs are outdated for the most part and lack an overall high quality in the aforementioned aspects~\citep{reimer:2023}. To fill this gap, \cite{reimer:2023} published a query log from a new source that had not been used before. The new resource, called the \textit{Archive Query Log} (AQL), is on par with private query logs in terms of number of queries, time span and further quality aspects. The scope of the AQL supports many tasks in information retrieval research and can be used to promote research in this field. This is however only possible if the query log is trustworthy and reflects realistic user bahaviour. In this thesis, we investigate the trustworthiness of the AQL and provide a comprehensive analysis of the log. To judge the authenticity of the AQL, we compare it to other public available query logs, which are known to show real user behaviour. The comparison is based on various metrics that aim to capture most characteristics of a query log.
